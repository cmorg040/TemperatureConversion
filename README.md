# TemperatureConversion
Simple C program for printing a table of temperatures. The table will display both Fahrenheit and Celsius, and their converted values, spaced at a user defined interval.

This program takes a non-negative integer between 1-9 as input. The program then prints a table of Fahrenheit temperatures, and their converted values in Celsius. Celsius to Fahrenheit values are also printed. Temperatures are printed from -80 - 320 degrees. Temperatures are printed at a set interval, defined by the user input.
